# Weather Forecast App

Created as part of a code-along to Stephen Grider's [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) class.

User types in a city name and receives a map and five-day forecast with charts for temperature, pressure and humidity. Uses OpenWeatherMap, Google Maps and Sparklines.
